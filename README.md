  **Overview of Analysis**
  
  The goal of this analysis was to create a statistical analysis of the temperatires in Oahu which is an island located west of Hawaii. 
  I was able to gather data for the months of June and December to determine if the surf and ice cream shop buisness would be sustainable
  all year long. 
  
  I created a query that captured the temperatures for the month of June and December. I was able to pull the nessessary data to determine 
  the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures.
  
  **Results**
  
  For the June Temperatures, we were able to discover that there were 1700 observation done during the time period of June from 2010 to 2017. The low 
  standard deviations shows that the weather in Oahu doesnt change very often. There was a very small margtin of change over the years when at the temperature
  data shown below.

  For the December Temperature, there is a difference in the amount of observation that were performed which is unfortunate. The month of December only had 1,517 oberservations performed. Even though there was a difference in the amount of the observation, the standards deviatation wasnt actually that big of a difference. It was stil in the 3% margine. I think it would be safe to assume that there may have actually been a 1% percent difference if I would have been able to extract the other 183 observations that were missing in which still would have been a small marginal difference.
